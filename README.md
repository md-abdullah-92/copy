# AgriBazaar


## Project Overview
AgriBazaar is an AI-powered digital marketplace designed for agents, farmers, and buyers. It enables direct communication, product management, and order tracking, creating an efficient platform for agricultural transactions.

### Key Features:
1. **Self-Registration for Agents, Farmers, and Buyers:**  
   Agents, farmers, and buyers can register, manage their profiles, products, and track orders independently.

2. **Direct Sales for Farmers:**  
   Farmers can sell products directly to buyers, bypassing middlemen, leading to better profits for farmers and lower costs for buyers.

3. **Feedback System and Transactions:**  
   Buyers can leave reviews and ratings after transactions. Detailed receipts are generated for every transaction, promoting transparency.

4. **AI-Powered Assistance:**  
   AgriBazaar integrates AI to assist farmers and buyers with product information and transactional details.

5. **Direct Communication:**  
   Agents and buyers can communicate with each other, similar to popular messaging apps like Messenger, to discuss product details and negotiate deals.

6. **Home Delivery and Order Tracking:**  
   Farmers can provide home delivery services, and buyers can track their orders in real-time.
